# Volka-Bot
![](https://i.imgur.com/KfJsvmc.png)
Discord bot helpful in management of server and keeping track of youtube channels, blog posts, and git commits of the repositories that the server is subscribed to by the whitelisted members of the server(mods/leads).

#### Packages used:
- Discord.jl : Bot is written completely in Julia using this package
- Firebase.jl : for realtime database to maintain the lists
- GitHub.jl : to access the git repos and other important documents
- HTTP.jl
- JSON.jl

I also use Youtube search API to keep check of the videos that are being uploaded to the subscribed channels. And for the medium posts, I use RSS feed and RSS parser to parse the RSS feed and get the latest posts.

Hosted on: Heroku
